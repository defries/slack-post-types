# Slack Post Types

Very simple plugin meant to work in conjunction with the Slack plugin in the WordPress repository.

## What does this do?
This plugin adds a menu to the Slack plugin's which allows you to select which Custom Post Types you want to include in the general settings of the Slack plugin. By selecting the Custom Post Types you want to include you'll be able to push notifications to your Slack channel.

## That's it?
Yup, that's it.
